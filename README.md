## Welcome to djguzmanc page!

I am David Guzmán, 22 years old. 

Computing engineering student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, 4 years have passed since my first day at the university.

## Interests

When I was studying object oriented programming I wanted to develop a game as a class project, but I thought Java wasn't the best way to handle graphics, then I found Processing (2.0 at the time) and started to create my game. Probably developed 3 games that just disappear when my hard drive crashed, however I continued with Processing developing for my career projects.

Honestly I found graphic projects very interesting, projects that give to you the tools for building or creating things that allow you to explain or demonstrate an idea.

## Projects

### AlgBuilder

I'm currently working on a programming language project that allows you to create graphical animations for data structures like array o linked lists, even graphs. All graphics were handled with Processing.

It can be found [here](https://github.com/djguzmanc/AlgBuilder).

### Conway's Game of life editor

One day I was trying to test a shape configuration for the game of life and see its results, but online editors just offer big grids with small cells which makes it difficult to design shapes, so I started to develop this editor, allowing the user to create, save and edit shapes, even debugging generations. Made with pure Processing.

It can be found [here](https://github.com/djguzmanc/GameOfLife).
